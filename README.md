# Gyroscope and Proximity
## What is it
- Proximity
It is a sensor that detects if an object is in its proximity.
Proximity sensors are commonly used in smartphones, cars and security systems.
There are different types of sensors for if you want to detect metal, plastic etc.
We will concentrate about the types in phones. In an iPhone 5 they use a Capacitive sensor which detects if anything conductive or dielectric from air.
Which means that if anything is more or less conductive then air it will detect it.
- Gyroscope

It measures the angular velocity. it measures the rational velocity of 3 different directions.
Here is a gif that shows how it works with a gyroscope.

Here is how we use it with a phone or tablet. 
We have the 3 axises x, y and z.
It is used by the phone to see if it should show you in portrait or landscape.

## How can we use it

The gyroscope can be used for games or apps.
The phone generaly uses the gyroscope to see if the phone should use the portrait or landscape layout.
it can also be used for games, take a flight game where when you tilt your phone you should go up and down while if you tilt left and right you should turn left and right.
